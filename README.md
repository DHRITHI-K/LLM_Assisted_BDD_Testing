This project demonstrates a simple LLM-assisted Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
functional testing workflow for a sample web application.

## Key Features
- Plain English business requirements as input
- LLM-generated BDD (Gherkin) scenarios
- Scenario validation and manual approval
- Automated execution of happy-path scenarios using BDD
